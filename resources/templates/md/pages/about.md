In this blog are some of my thoughts on programming.
 My goal here is for you, the reader, to rapidly acquire some insights which took me a long time to achieve - and as an added benefit, 
 to gain a better grasp of these notions myself, by putting them into words.

## About me

<img src="/img/vw-dcd18.jpg" class="about-profile-pic">

My name is **Valentin Waeselynck**, I'm a French engineer specialized in sofware programming.

I started programming when I was 14, starting in the exotic domain of artificial life systems.
 Since then, I've been fortunate enough to tackle a broad range of problems with a wide variety of technologies and approaches, building modern web applications, data processing pipelines, data analysis algorithms, custom search/query engines and various programming tools for supporting this work. 

Lately, I have specialized in the **[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)** programming language and **[Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/)** database,
 and more generally in reactive and data-centric architectures for information systems.
 I have made a few open-source contributions in these areas, in the form of [some libraries](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval)
 and the [official Clojure REPL guide](https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction).

Some creations:

* [**ecolog10.org**](https://www.ecolog10.org/): a website presenting the use of logarithmic representations for considering reductions of GHG emissions. [Source code](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/ecolog10) _(ClojureScript, Vega, Vega-lite)_.
* [**m12**](https://dozenal-music.netlify.app/): an environment for experimenting a 12-digits notation for Western music. [Source code](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/m12) _(ClojureScript)_
* [**reddit-bots.patience**](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/reddit_bots#reddit-botspatience): a Reddit bot for moderating a sub (such as [r/patient_hackernews](https://www.reddit.com/r/patient_hackernews)) so that immediate replies immediate replies are impossible, in the hope of fostering thoughtful discussion. _(Clojure)_

Aside from programming, I enjoy mathematics, climbing mountains, and playing music. 

### Consulting

I'm available for software engineering consulting engagements (only remote at present).
 
More precisely, my contribution may take some of the following forms:
* high-level software development (in various settings, which you could label as "fullstack" / "frontend" / "backend" / "devops" / ...),
* scientific programming (e.g Data Science / Machine Learning / Data Mining)
* software architecture,
* training,
* "production-izing algorithms", e.g bridging the gap between an R&D department and an IT department.

If you think I may be useful to your project, please [contact](mailto:val.vvalval@gmail.com) me.
